# Algorithms
An exploration into algorithms using Rust

## List of algorithms in this crate currently:
* Merge sort with inversion search
    * Given an arbitrary array, this will sort and count the number of inversions. This runs in Θ(nlogn) time.
* Quick sort
    * Given an arbitrary array, this will sort it using the Hoare's quick sort algorithm. This runs in:
        * Best and Avg case Θ(nlogn) time.
        * Worst case O(n^2) time.
* Closest pair search on a 2 dimensional plane
    * Given an arbitrary array of 2d points, this will find the closest pair
    * Not finished
* Insertion sort
    * Given an arbitrary array, this will sort it using the insertion sort algorithm. This runs in O(n^2) time.
